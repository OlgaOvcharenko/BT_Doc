\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental_setup}

All experiments were conducted on a Hadoop cluster using 3 worker nodes. 
Each node has a single AMD EPYC 7302 CPUs @ 3.0-3.3 GHz (16 physical/32 virtual cores, and 128 GB DDR4 RAM (peak performance is 768 GFLOP/s, 183.2 GB/s).
The software stack comprises Ubuntu 20.04.1, Python 3.8.10, Apache Hadoop 3.3.1, Apache Spark 3.2, PySpark 3.2, Pandas 1.4.3, and NumPy 1.23.1.

\textbf{Apache Spark} with 3 executor nodes is using OpenJDK 11.0.13 with both drivers and local set to 100 GB memory.
Further settings are: executor cores=32, deploy mode is client, heartbeat interval=50 sec, network timeout=100000 sec.
The default heartbeat and timeout lead to termination before the long running job is done, therefore the settings are manually set to increased values.
