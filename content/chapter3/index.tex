\chapter{Chapter 3 Benchmark}
In this chapter we describe the benchmark and its components: data generation, error generation, and validation of the results.
Unlike other frameworks discussed in Section 2, WashHouse needs only the datasets as an input. We scale both clean and dirty versions, and introduce errors to the first one.
The corresponding error types and rates are configurable.
