\chapter*{Abstract}

% State the problem (50 words)
Data preparation is a crucial part of the data science lifecycle.
Most state-of-the-art tools and frameworks contain data cleaning functionality, 
but many of them require manual effort to prepare the input or define constraints.
% There is a lack of cleaning for ML benchmarks, 
- There is a lack of large datasets with GT or only synthetic that dont reproduce real-world problems
- For evaluation of tools large new datasets are needed

% Say why it is  an interesting problem (100 words)
- Challenge of large data set cleaning (current design is validated small scale in papers)

% Say what your solution achieves (50 words)
- Scaling to x
- Running time scale Linear
- New algorithms
- Statistics preservation

% Say what follows from your solution (25 words)
- Establishment of new benchmarks with scaling datasets with stable properties.
