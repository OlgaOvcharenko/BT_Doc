This chapter presents the background and related work starting with Section~\ref{sec:data_cleaning_problems} describing general problems in the area of data cleaning.
In Section~\ref{sec:data_cleaning_tools} current state-of-the-art cleaning tools are presented and discussed.
Although, data cleaning is the not main goal of this work, the results of the generator are intended to be used to evaluate data cleaning tools.
